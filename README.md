WARNING
=========


Not recommended to use this.. as it's a modified version of the discord.js-commando framework(This is configured for the discord.js master branch/v12) and is for the Elara Discord Bots.
=======

I strongly suggest you use the [discord.js-commando](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js-commando) package from the discord.js developers!
============

Just a fyi... you will not recieve any support using this code or anything in this repository.. any suggestions for new features should go to the discord.js-commando team, if you want to suggest something go to their discord server or open a issue on their github page. https://github.com/discordjs/Commando/issues
