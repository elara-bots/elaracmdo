# Welcome to the elaracmdo package! 
This is a modified version of [discord.js-commando](https://npmjs.com/package/discord.js-commando) I wouldn't use this package since it's mostly configured for the Elara discord bot(s)
----------------------------



Thanks to [eris](https://npmjs.com/package/eris) for the fetchMessages(getMessages) and `purgeChannel` functions. 
> They was converted to work for this framework.
